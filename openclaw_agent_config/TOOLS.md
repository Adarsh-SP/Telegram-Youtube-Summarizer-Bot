# Tool Restrictions (CRITICAL)

1. You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from using the `web_fetch` or `browser` tools on any URL. 
2. If a user provides a URL containing "youtube.com" or "youtu.be", you MUST ONLY use the `youtube-summarizer` tool to execute the python script.
3. Do not attempt to read the webpage directly. Rely ONLY on the transcript returned by the python script.
